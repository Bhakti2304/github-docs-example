# Writing Good Documentation

## Step 1 - using Codeblocks.

Codeblocks in markdown make it *very easy* for tech people to **copy, paste, share** code.
A good _Cloud Engineer_ uses Codeblocks whenever possible.

Because it allows others to copy and paste their code to replicate or research issues.

## Step 3 - Use Github Flavoured Markdown Task Lists.

Github extends MArkdown to have a list where you can check off items.
